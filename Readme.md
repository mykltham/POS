### Overview

- The solution has 3 projects: 
 - POS - A console program to showcase the PointOfSaleTerminal Class,
 - POS.Application - The actual project for the PointOfSaleTerminal Class, Entities, and Interfaces
 - POS.Application.Unit.Test - A unit test project which has added the suggested scenario for automated testing purposes.

- The Point Of Sale Terminal supports also multiple-tiered volume pricing, e.g 3 for $5, 5 for $8, 
- I had added a scenario on the console program to illustrate this capability to handle multiple-tiered volume pricing.
